# 🎵 MI-Based Music Recommendation System

A personalized music recommendation system powered by Machine Learning and intelligent algorithms to suggest music based on user preferences, behavior, and audio features.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application that leverages machine learning and intelligent algorithms to recommend music to users. It analyzes user behavior, song metadata, and audio features to generate recommendations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Personalized music recommendations
- 🔍 Search and browse songs
- ❤️ Like/Dislike to train the model
- 📊 Music clustering using audio features
- 👤 User-based and item-based collaborative filtering
- 🤖 Machine Learning model for content-based recommendations
- 🌐 Full stack: Backend + Frontend + ML model

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js / HTML / CSS / TailwindCSS
- Axios for API calls

### Backend
- Python (Flask / FastAPI / Django)
- RESTful API
- SQLite / PostgreSQL / MongoDB

### Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy
- Spotify API / Librosa for audio features
- Collaborative Filtering
- K-Means / KNN / Matrix Factorization

## 📂 Project Structure


## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Load music metadata and audio features (e.g., from Spotify or your own dataset).
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract audio features like tempo, danceability, energy, etc.
3. **Model Training**: Use collaborative and content-based filtering to build a hybrid recommender system.
4. **User Interaction**: Users can like or skip songs to improve their recommendations.
5. **Serving Recommendations**: Backend serves ML predictions via API to the frontend.

## 🧪 Installation & Usage

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
//front end
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
 Future Improvements
